// Abishek always participates in competitive programming because he enjoys
// solving competitive programming questions. PrepBuddy organizes a coding 
// competition and announces a big price for the winner. He gave an array and 
// asked to find the maximum difference between indexes (jâ€“i) such that 
// arr[j]>arr[i]where j>i. Abhishek is not able to solve this problem, but he 
// wants to win this competitive programming. So he is asking for help.
